Project Outline: E-commerce Website
1. Project Overview
Develop a basic e-commerce website where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed through a checkout process. The project will involve creating a front-end user interface, a back-end server to handle data, and a database to store product information and user data.

2. Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (for a more dynamic UI)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (or another NoSQL database)
Additional Tools: Redux for state management, Axios for API calls, Stripe for payment processing (optional)
3. Core Features
Product Listing

Display a list of products fetched from the database.
Include product details such as name, price, image, and description.
Allow users to filter products by category and price.
Product Details Page

Show detailed information about a selected product.
Include an option to add the product to the shopping cart.
Shopping Cart

Display a list of products added to the cart.

Protect certain routes so only authenticated users can access them (e.g., checkout page).
Checkout Process

Create a form to collect shipping information.
Implement payment processing (optional, can use Stripe).
Confirm the order and store order details in the database.
